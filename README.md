## üõ† Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **MSYS2 (64-bit)**: Install from [msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org/).
2. **Ensure System Path Configuration:** Add `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin` to your system PATH.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Run the following commands in the MSYS2 terminal:

```bash
pacman -Syu
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc \
          mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config \
          mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5 \
          mingw-w64-x86_64-quazip \
          mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake \
          mingw-w64-x86_64-make \
          mingw-w64-x86_64-libtool \
          mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib \
          mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl
```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drDOOM69GAMING/REAIO.git
cd REAIO
```

### Step 3: Compile the Application

1. Generate the meta-object code:

   ```bash
   moc REAIO.cpp -o REAIO.moc
   ```

2. Compile the project:

   ```bash
   g++ -I/mingw64/include/qt5 -I/mingw64/include/QuaZip-Qt5-1.4/quazip \
       -L/mingw64/lib \
       -o REAIO.exe REAIO.cpp \
       $(pkg-config --cflags --libs Qt5Widgets Qt5Gui Qt5Core Qt5Network Qt5Concurrent) \
       -lquazip1-qt5 -lz
   ```

### Step 4: Deploy Dependencies

#### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
windeployqt REAIO.exe
```

This command copies all required Qt DLLs and plugins automatically.

#### Manual Deployment (If Issues Occur)

Copy the following from `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin` to your project folder:

```
Qt5Core.dll, Qt5Gui.dll, Qt5Widgets.dll, Qt5Network.dll, Qt5Concurrent.dll, 
libquazip1-qt5.dll, zlib1.dll, libwinpthread-1.dll, libstdc++-6.dll, libgcc_s_seh-1.dll
```

Create subfolders `plugins/imageformats` and copy:

```
qwindows.dll (from mingw64/plugins/platforms)
*.dll (from mingw64/plugins/imageformats)
```

---

## Directory Structure

Ensure your project folder contains the following:

```
REAIO.exe
REAIO.cpp
RE1.png, RE2.png, RE3.png
bearer/
iconengines/
platforms/
plugins/imageformats/
styles/
+ All DLLs listed in the deployment step
```
